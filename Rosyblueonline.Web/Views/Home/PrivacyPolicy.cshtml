                            Cookies
                        </p>
                        <p>"Cookies" are pieces of data or text files that are sent by a web server that are saved by your internet browser and stored on your computer. Use of cookies is industry standard and information contained in cookies will enhance your experience on the Site. Cookies are used to analyze web page flow, evaluate promotions, deliver you a personalized shopping experience, track visits from our partners/affiliates and allow the use of our shopping cart. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Rosyblue does not use cookies to collect or store any personal information, but they may be tied to the personal information you knowingly choose to provide to us.</p>
                        <p>
                            We may use two types of cookies - session cookies and persistent cookies - to enable us to collect aggregate information on the usage patterns of the Site, such as what areas of the Site are visited most often, so that we can tailor the Site to user preferences. Session cookies exist only for as long as your Internet browser remains open. When the session ends, the Internet browser is closed and the cookies go away. Persistent cookies, in contrast, last from visit to visit. Persistent cookies are saved on a visitor’s computer by the Internet browser and do not go away when you exit your Internet browser.
                            You have control over cookies. Most Internet browsers can be set to refuse to accept cookies, although this may affect your Internet experience, including your use of the Site. You can also erase cookies that are already on your computer, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your Internet browser instructions or “help” screen to learn more about these functions. If you choose to have your Internet browser refuse cookies, the Site may not function properly for you.

                        <p style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:4px; text-decoration:underline;">Embedded Pixels/ Web Beacons</p>
                        <p>The Web Site’s pages may also contain embedded electronic images or pixel technologies, commonly referred to as web beacons. These web beacons allow Rosyblue to track the number of users who have visited the Web Site’s pages and may also be used to assist in delivering cookies on the Web Site. In addition, we may also include beacons in our e-mail messages in order to track whether the message has been opened or acted upon.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:4px; text-decoration:underline;">Embedded URLs</p>
                        <p>Rosyblue may also use a tracking technique that employs embedded URLs to allow use of the Site without cookies. Embedded URLs allow limited information to follow you as you navigate the Site, but is not associated with personal information and is not used beyond the session.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:4px; text-decoration:underline;">Third Party Advertising and Content Delivery</p>
                        <p>Rosyblue may also use third-party advertising or content delivery companies to serve ads or images on the Web Site. These third-parties may use web beacons to save a cookie on your computer. This allows the third party to recognize your computer each time you visit the Web Site or e-mails, and to compile anonymous information.</p>

                        <p style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:4px; text-decoration:underline;">Security</p>
                        <p>Rosyblue is committed to the protection of the personal information that you share with us. We utilize a combination of security technologies, procedures and organizational measures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Whenever we transfer sensitive personal information over the internet, we protect it using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. Certain personally identifiable information that you submit to us may, however, not be encrypted during transmission, and with respect to such information Rosyblue restricts access to such information to those employees who need access to the information in order to do their jobs. Encryption technology makes it difficult for your credit card information to be intercepted or stolen while being transmitted. However, it is not possible to guarantee the security or integrity of information disclosed online because no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure.</p>
                        <p>If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. If you are sharing a computer with anyone, we suggest you log out before leaving the Site in order to protect subsequent users from gaining access to your information.</p>
                        <p>We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Because no physical or electronic security is impenetrable, you recognize the inherent risk in the use of internet or such other data storage and transmission networks in collection, storage, access and transfer of information. By using the Site or e-mailing information to us, you agree to assume all risk in connection with the information sent to us or collected by us when using the Site.</p>

                        <p style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:4px; text-decoration:underline;">CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</p>
                        <p>Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, a California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship has the right to request from that business information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom such personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed, upon receipt of a request by a California resident. However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.</p>

                        <p style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:4px; text-decoration:underline;">How To Contact Us</p>
