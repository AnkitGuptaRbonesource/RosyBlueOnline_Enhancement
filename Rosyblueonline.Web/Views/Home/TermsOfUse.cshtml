During registration, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete Registration Data about yourself as prompted by the registration form and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. Registering with the Site will signify your agreement that all Registration Data provided is complete, accurate and up-to-date and an acknowledgement that you are responsible updating your Registration Data as necessary. You may not impersonate, imitate or pretend to be somebody else when registering and/or setting up an account on the Site. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, out-of-date or incomplete, or Rosyblue has grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, out-of-date or incomplete, Rosyblue may suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Site (or any portion thereof).</p>
                        <p>You may not authorize any third party to use your Registration Data. You may not sublicense, transfer, sell or assign your Registration Data to any third party without Rosyblue’s prior written approval. Any attempt to do so will be void from inception and a material breach of these T&C.</p>
                        <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Registration Data, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your Registration Data. You agree to notify Rosyblue immediately and in no event later than 24 hours after any unauthorized use of your Registration Data or any other breach of security. You are solely responsible for any and all use of such Registration Data. Rosyblue has the right to rely on any information you provide to us and shall have no liability for any such reliance.

The collection and use of all information submitted in connection with registration is subject to the terms of Rosyblue’s Privacy Policy.</p>
                        <p>You must be an authorized representative of a diamond/jewelry industry participant and at least eighteen (18) years of age to use the Site. Rosyblue reserves all rights to review your Registrant Information and allow or disallow your membership to the Site. Membership to the Site is void where prohibited.</p>

                        <p style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:4px; text-decoration:underline;">Policy on Conflict Diamonds</p>
                        <p>At Rosyblue, we only purchase rough and polished diamonds through the renowned and largest suppliers who, like us, proudly adhere to and enforce the standards established by the Kimberley Process, an international system that polices the trade of diamonds to ensure they are from sources free of conflict.</p>

                        <p style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:4px; text-decoration:underline;">Pricing & Inventory</p>
                        <p>All our prices are subject to change without prior notice. We apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause. Sometimes the data, including the price relating a diamond, may be displayed on our Web Site inaccurately due to typographical or system errors. We reserve the right to correct any and all such errors as and when they come to our notice. We do not honor orders which are placed based on such erroneous prices. If a product's listed price is lower than its actual price, we reserve the right, to contact you to update you with the correct information before shipping the product or cancel the order and notify you of such cancellation. If the order has been shipped, you agree to return the product or pay the difference between the actual and charged prices. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact your relationship manager at Rosyblue or our customer helpdesk at customercare@rosyblueonline.com.</p>
                        <p>If you're interested in diamonds that are currently out-of-stock, call your relationship manager at Rosyblue for an update on when the item will be available in stock. It may also happen that an item may go out of stock before we are able to post a notification on the Site. In such an event, we will contact you directly to discuss available options.</p>
                        <p>In the event there is a separate written agreement between you and Rosyblue concerning your ordering of stones and products from Rosyblue (a “Separate Agreement”), then unless otherwise stated in the Separate Agreement, in the event of any conflict between the Separate Agreement and these T&C, these T&C shall control.</p>

                        <p style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:4px; text-decoration:underline;">Diamond Certificates</p>
                        <p>Rosyblue ships all certified diamonds to you with the accompanying diamond grading report (also called a diamond certificate). These certificates are detailed reports provided by diamond grading experts at any of the highly-respected diamond laboratories - making it very expensive to replace a certificate. Hence any Diamond will not be accepted back as a return by Rosyblue if the same is not accompanied by its original diamond certificate.</p>

                        <p style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:4px; text-decoration:underline;">Non-Rosyblue Content</p>
